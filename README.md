# Crowdfunding_Analysis

Crowdfunding Report Written Analysis:
•	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
o	We can see the number of successful campaigns and failed campaigns are close, where the failed campaigns are just about or just under half of the successful ones.
o	We can argue that the campaigns are successful only 57% of the time based on total number of campaigns.
•	What are some limitations of this dataset?
o	There are many factors that can affect crowdfunding campaigns such as social/public awareness, political views, demographics etc. and that data was not included in this data set. 
	Social/Public awareness: is the public aware of the campaigns so they can engage? Did some campaigns have more coverage than the others?
	Political views: Do a majority of the general public that is being reached agree with/value the types of categories that these campaigns trying to raise money for? Are some categories valued more or less with this particular group of people?
	Demographic: What is the age of the people who are pledging money? Can the younger backers afford to give as much as the older ones? What is their ethnicity? Some cultures value arts over sciences.
•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
o	We could have added more bar graphs to look deeper into each subcategory and if the amount of money played a factor in its overall success rating.
o	We could have used a box and whisker plot or scatter plot to have a more accurate reading on individual categories. We would be able to see where the general data lies and identify any outliers that may be skewing the data.





The mean(average) better summarizes the data because it represents the average number of successful or failed campaigns. On average there were 851 successful campaigns and on average there were 586 unsuccessful campaigns.

We can see from our data that there is more variation in the number of backers in the successful campaign vs the numbers of backers in the unsuccessful campaigns. With the assumption that most people would use the number of campaign backers to assess the success of a crowdfunding campaign, the more backers you have for a campaign would yield a more successful campaign. In this case the variance doesn’t make so much sense because it shows the spread of how many backer a campaign has against the of the average number of backers that we already calcuated. We can already see the correlation of the successful campaigns has a significantly larger number of backers than the overall average.
